"""
The Ticket Room — assemble + inject step.

Runs AFTER the scorer (build15.py) has written D_0615.json = {players, meta}.
1) builds D['tickets'] via assemble_tickets.assemble() (pool gating, refill, names,
   notes — the brain), carrying over any game left suspended on the prior board,
2) injects the freshly assembled D into the published board's `const D=...` block.

The published index.html doubles as its own shell/template: we read it, swap the
data block, and write it back. All paths are repo-relative so it runs on the Action.
